DIFFERENT ANALYSIS CARRIED OUT AFTER PROCEEDING WITH THE IMPUTATION IN CHROMOSOME 22:

1- First all positions were analyzed and they were compared SNP type 2 with the reference, SNP type 3 and SNP type 1 (imputed)
   with the reference vcf from the individual (taken out from the panel previously in snp-ref format)
   PROBLEMS:
      - triallelic positions and more giving problems with SNP types
      - unordered alleles in the gen file
      - TOO MUCH positions from the beginning (not all of them informative) in the comparison
 
 2- Taken only biallelic positions with information of genotype and comparing the type 1, 2 and 3 with the reference as before:
    - Imputed SNPs increase instead of decreasing with coverage
    -Low number of 3 SNPs now because removed 0/0 pos -> all one missing allele are removed when doing this analysis
    - SNPs with genotype 0/0 that should be considered in the comparison for polimorphic SNPs are skipped in the analysis (even if
    they are monomorphic in our study data they are important to know if the software predicts well)
    - percentage too high of well genotyped from the beginning SNPs (May be fixed positions)
    - Not yet high coverage downsampled to use it as reference that evrything is going OK in the analysis.
    - Look if there is some BIAS in the wrong imputed positions from the total impouted positions
    - The amount of beforehand known positions does not saturate because we are missing all the 0/0 genotypes when doing the analysis
    this way
 
 
 3- Taking only biallelic POLIMORPHIC POSITIONS to compare reference vcf with downsampled vcf and watch the progress that the IMPUTATION is
    carrying out on the data:
    PROBLEMS:
    -TYPE2 positions with fixed allele also in panel have not a problem (WELL type2 settled)
    - Type SNP3 (not integrated in the imputations) positions which are considered different snps from the vcf reference when they are not just because
    they are monomorphic in the study data and polimorphoic in the panel of chimps.
    - All type3 are genotyped as 0/0 (not all will be like that) and all type 2 have 2 alleles and are genotyped as 0/1 or 1/1 in the downsampled study
    data --> this will be changed by following advise of oxford mail from one rersearcher, doing a previous filtering step on the gen input
    data of IMPUTE2 missing those type3 positions could lead always in worse results in the Imputation process.
    - Now decreases the Impoutation positions but is still being really bad the percentage of right genotyped imputed positions
    It saturates quickly 
    - Look if there is some BIAS in the wrong imputed positions from the total impouted positions
