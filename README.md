# Imputation-Analysis

2nd Part of the analysis where I focus on using BEAGLE software to impute genotype dosages on lcWGS samples
by parsing genotype likelihoods on the software and retrieveing the best quality positions

1- likelihood as PL calculated from GATK UnifiedGenotyper 

2-Merging of desired samples

3- Filtering of the panel to impute

4-  Use of splitvcfjar and mergevcfjar functions

5- Imputation

6 -ANALYSIS scripts with in-house python scriptsA
